Description:

In this project, I will use a dataset formed through a survey of many different kinds of people on some of their general preferences and what gender they identify with. I plan to find the correlation, if any, between these preferences and gender to see if gender, which we know to be a social construct, is influenced by minor preferences and interests. I suspect that our interests and preferences, no matter how small, partially drive the way we perceive ourselves and in turn, the gender we ascribe ourselves to. It is important to note that gender, just like preferences and interests, is fluid and can change with time, but looking for ways in which the small influence the large regarding our self-perception will continue to be important for gender research and sociological studies. Another point of observation of this project will be the ways in which stereotypes for genders are upheld or dismantled in reality, and whether the preferences of men and women actually reflect the societal expectations that we hold for them.
